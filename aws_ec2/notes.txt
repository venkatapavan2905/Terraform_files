1. Replace option 
     This option is used to destroy and recreate a resource even though if there are no changes made to it.
  
   syntax: terraform apply -replace=<resource_type>.<resource_name>

   example: terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.ec2

   Instance Id of the ec2 chnages when destroyed and recreated.
